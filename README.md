## Key insights
- Support form colleagues and decision influence are curcial's factor for the workers' wellbeing: when these are low, the probability of developing stress and depression increases significantly.
- Living in a country with a "liberal welfare" system or "socialdemocratic welfare" system is different: in the first case (UK, Ireland), workers are more linkely to fall in to category "depression". In contrast, those living in a country like Norway, Finland, Sweden or Denmark, are more likely to be in the category of "normal", with a good level of mental health.
- Wellbeing follows a U-shaped trend with age.
